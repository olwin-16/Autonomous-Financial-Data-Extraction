# **Autonomous Financial Data Extraction Agents** â€” 33rd Cohort Fellowship.AI

## **Project Overview**

This repository documents the research, benchmarking, and evaluation of autonomous web agents for real-time financial data extraction conducted by the 33rd cohort of the Fellowship.AI program.

The project journeyed through three major agent frameworks: Midscene.js, UI-TARS Desktop Agent, and finally the Proxy-lite agent. Each agent was assessed not only for accuracy and finish rates but also their resource efficiency, reliability, and practicality in complex financial scraping tasks.

The Proxy-lite agent emerged as the recommended choice due to its balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

## **Evaluation of Agents**

## **Midscene.js Chrome Extension**

**Repository**: [Midscene](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene)

**Technical Summary**

- Midscene.js operates as a Chrome extension utilizing vision-language models (VLMs) configured with UI-TARS 7-B SFT. It automates browsing via natural language prompts to extract and structure financial data.

**Key Challenge**

- Faced a critical token limit error (422 Input Validation; inputs tokens + max_new_tokens > 32,768), severely limiting the complexity of tasks it could handle. Attempts to reduce inputs or max tokens failed to circumvent this.

**Example Failure**

- Failed to extract the BBC homepage headline due to exceeding token limits despite aggressive input shortening.

**Other Limitations**

- Manual scrolling and dynamic webpage elements were inadequately handled, resulting in incomplete outputs.

**Outcome**

- Although providing a valuable baseline and easy UI, these constraints prompted migration to UI-TARS Desktop for enhanced capability.

## **UI-TARS Desktop Agent**

**Repository**: [UI-TARS](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS)

**Technical Implementation**

- UI-TARS Desktop is a GUI-based autonomous agent powered by multimodal vision-language models (7B DPO primary, 2B SFT secondary). Hosted as a standalone Windows/Linux application with Hugging Face endpoints.

**Installation and Launch**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS.git
cd UI-TARS

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate             # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch service
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --served-model-name ui-tars --model path_to_model

# Local UI start
pnpm install && pnpm run dev

```

**Performance Highlights**

- Efficiently completed complex financial scraping tasks, including calculating loan EMI for HDFC Bank in ~2 minutes.
- Outperformed Midscene in reliability and multimodal input processing while demonstrating token-limit resilience.

**Limitations**

- Computationally demanding (requires GPUs, Hugging Face endpoints).
- Encountered runtime instability, including Colab crashes and occasional failures in supplemental tasks (e.g., saving screenshots).
- Benchmarked on reasoning datasets (GSM8K, ScienceQA, HellaSwag) showed modest accuracy (~10-40%) without further multimodal finetuning.

**Team Contributions**

- Extensive testing performed by Olwin Christian, Rahul Thakur, and Iremide Oloyede, with mentor supervision.
- Runtime and scraping stability refined through collaborative iterations.

## **Proxy-lite Agent** (Final Selection)

**Repository**: [Proxy-Lite](https://github.com/convergence-ai/proxy-lite)

**Technical Implementation**

- Proxy-lite is a lightweight, CPU-efficient web agent performing browser-based scraping via JavaScript DOM interaction, explicitly avoiding OCR.

**Advantages**

- Does not require GPU or dedicated inference endpoints.
- High finish (87.8%) and success (95.1%) rates on the WebVoyager dataset.
- Balanced precision and recall across critical web interaction actions.

**Typical usage example** (educational snippet)

```bash

from proxy_lite import Runner, RunnerConfig
from transformers import AutoProcessor
from proxy_lite.tools import ReturnValueTool, BrowserTool
from proxy_lite.serializer import OpenAICompatibleSerializer
import asyncio

config = RunnerConfig.from_dict({
    "environment": {"name": "webbrowser", "homepage": "https://www.google.com/", "headless": True},
    "solver": {"name": "simple", "agent": {"name": "proxy_lite", "client": {"name": "convergence"}}},
    "max_steps": 50,
    "model_id": "convergence-ai/proxy-lite-3b",
    "api_base": "https://convergence-ai-demo-api.hf.space/v1",
    "action_timeout": 1800,
    "environment_timeout": 1800,
    "task_timeout": 18000,
    "logger_level": "DEBUG",
})

proxy = Runner(config=config)

message_history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Proxy Lite, a web-browsing agent..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London today?"}
]

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("convergence-ai/proxy-lite-3b")
tools = OpenAICompatibleSerializer().serialize_tools([ReturnValueTool(), BrowserTool(session=None)])

templated_messages = processor.apply_chat_template(message_history, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True, tools=tools)

async def main():
    response = await proxy.run(templated_messages)
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())

```
