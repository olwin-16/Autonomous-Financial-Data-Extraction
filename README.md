# **Autonomous Financial Data Extraction Agents** â€” 33rd Cohort Fellowship.AI

## **Project Overview**

This repository documents the research, benchmarking, and evaluation of autonomous web agents for real-time financial data extraction conducted by the 33rd cohort of the Fellowship.AI program.

The project journeyed through three major agent frameworks: Midscene.js, UI-TARS Desktop Agent, and finally the Proxy-lite agent. Each agent was assessed not only for accuracy and finish rates but also their resource efficiency, reliability, and practicality in complex financial scraping tasks.

The Proxy-lite agent emerged as the recommended choice due to its balance of efficiency and effectiveness.
